## 💰 FINANCIAL PROPOSAL GUIDANCE

### Positioning Your Rate:

**Why $500-550/day is justified:**
1. **15+ years experience** (well above their 5-year minimum)
2. **Enterprise-scale expertise** (led $2M+ projects)
3. **Technical skills** rare in non-profit sector
4. **Independent consultant** (no supervision needed)
5. **Proven results** (150% traffic increases, measurable ROI)

**Rate Comparable To:**
- UN P4 level professional
- Senior communication consultant
- Mid-to-senior digital strategist in international development

**Note:** You can go slightly lower ($450-480/day) if you want to be more competitive, but don't undervalue yourself. Your corporate experience is an asset.

### Alternative Approach: Lump Sum

Instead of daily rate, you could propose:
- **Fixed fee for 7 months:** $75,000 USD
- Plus travel/expenses: $15,000 USD
- **Total:** $90,000 USD all-inclusive

This might be simpler and shows you're outcome-focused rather than time-tracking focused.
