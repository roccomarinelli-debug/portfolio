**UNICEF Recruitment Team**
Global Learning Innovation Hub
Helsinki, Finland

**Re: Digital Education Communications and Storytelling Consultant (Job ID: 4309591046)**

---

Dear UNICEF Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my profound interest in the Digital Education Communications and Storytelling Consultant position with UNICEF's Global Learning Innovation Hub. This opportunity represents the convergence of my 15+ years of strategic communication expertise, my deep personal commitment to education, and a life decision that speaks to the very heart of UNICEF's mission: **I am relocating my family from Australia to Helsinki specifically so my children can be educated in the Finnish school system.**

## Education: Not Just My Career, But My Life's Priority

My Finnish wife and I have made the deliberate choice to uproot our lives and move our children to Finland for one reason above all others—**their education**. When you believe so deeply in the transformative power of quality education that you're willing to relocate your entire family across the world, working for UNICEF to ensure every child has access to world-class learning opportunities isn't just a job—it's a calling that aligns perfectly with my personal values and life decisions.

This isn't about pivoting from corporate to non-profit. This is about applying 15 years of communication excellence to the cause I've literally restructured my family's life around: ensuring children receive the education they deserve.

## Why UNICEF's Mission Resonates So Deeply

UNICEF's Digital Education Strategy 2025-2030—with its vision of reaching 350+ million children, particularly those most marginalized and underserved—represents exactly the kind of impact-driven work I want to dedicate my professional skills toward. Having chosen the Finnish education system for my own children, I understand firsthand what world-class, equitable education looks like. The thought that UNICEF is working to bring that level of opportunity to every child, regardless of circumstance, is both inspiring and urgent.

Your initiatives—from the Blue Unicorn Portfolio scaling proven EdTech solutions to 100+ million children, to the Learning Cabinet making quality digital learning resources accessible, to programs like Accessible Digital Textbooks ensuring children with disabilities aren't left behind—these aren't abstract concepts to me. They represent children like mine, and millions more who deserve the same chances.

## Strategic Communication Excellence Meets Education Sector Experience

**Corporate Communication Leadership (15+ Years)**

I bring proven strategic communication expertise from Australia's leading organizations:

- **Telstra (2022-Present):** Content Designer for Australia's largest telecommunications company, creating user-centric content that educates millions of customers on complex digital services
- **Transurban (2015-2018):** Led $2M+ digital transformation project educating 500,000+ users, achieving 10-point NPS improvement through accessible, educational content
- **Techtronic Industries (2018-2021):** Managed global content strategy, implementing enterprise CMS solutions and content governance across 10+ international brands
- **iSelect (2018):** Achieved Top 5 rankings for 50+ keywords through educational content that made complex financial concepts accessible

**Education Sector Experience (Often Overlooked)**

What many don't know is that I've also worked directly in educational institutions:

- **RMIT University:** Developed communication strategies and content for one of Australia's leading universities, understanding firsthand how educational institutions communicate their value, programs, and impact to diverse stakeholder groups
- **Kangan TAFE:** Created content for vocational and technical education audiences, learning how to make practical skills training accessible and engaging for learners from diverse backgrounds

This education sector experience gives me insight into:
- How educational institutions think and operate
- The unique communication challenges in education contexts
- The importance of inclusive, accessible learning content
- The balance between inspiration and practical information
- Stakeholder management across students, educators, parents, and partners

**Formal Qualifications in Communication**

My commitment to communication excellence is grounded in formal education across three distinct disciplines:

1. **Bachelor of Arts (Professional Writing) - Deakin University**
   - Technical and creative writing mastery
   - Content strategy fundamentals
   - Audience-centric communication design

2. **Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) - Monash University**
   - Investigative storytelling and narrative structure
   - Ethical communication and fact-based reporting
   - Digital media production and editing
   - Compelling human-interest story development

3. **Bachelor of Business (Marketing) - Monash University**
   - Strategic communication and brand positioning
   - Consumer behavior and audience psychology
   - Data-driven decision making
   - Multi-channel campaign development

This trifecta of qualifications—**writing craft, storytelling journalism, and strategic marketing**—creates exactly the skill combination UNICEF needs: someone who can write compellingly, tell human-impact stories authentically, and position UNICEF strategically as a global leader in digital education transformation.

## What I Bring to UNICEF's Digital Education Communications

### 1. Proven Communication Strategy Development

At Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications company, I lead content design for millions of customers, creating strategies that transform complex technical information into accessible learning experiences. At Transurban, I developed communication frameworks that educated 500,000+ users through major digital change, achieving measurable satisfaction improvements.

I know how to:
- Update and implement communication strategies aligned with organizational missions
- Develop channel-specific content plans with clear KPIs
- Create messaging frameworks that resonate across diverse audiences
- Monitor effectiveness and optimize based on data

### 2. High-Volume, High-Quality Content Production

Over 15 years, I've produced every format UNICEF requires:

**Human Interest Stories:** My journalism background means I know how to find and tell compelling stories that put human faces on statistics—exactly what UNICEF needs to demonstrate the impact of digital education on individual children's lives

**Newsletters:** Regular content production across email, web, and internal channels keeping stakeholders informed and engaged

**Website Content:** From Telstra's customer-facing digital platforms to enterprise CMS implementations, I've created web content that educates, engages, and converts

**Social Media:** Managed LinkedIn and multi-platform content strategies at iSelect and throughout my career, understanding platform-specific approaches and engagement optimization

**Thought Leadership:** Written executive-level content, donor proposals, and strategic communications that position organizations as industry leaders

**Multimedia Coordination:** Worked with photographers, videographers, and designers to create cohesive visual storytelling across campaigns

### 3. Technical Capabilities Rare in Non-Profit Sector

**CMS & Web Development:**
- WordPress, Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), Contentful, Drupal
- Can update websites hands-on, not just write briefs for others
- Understand technical constraints and opportunities

**AI Tools Proficiency:**
- ChatGPT, Claude for content creation and optimization
- Midjourney for visual concept development
- AI-assisted content production for efficiency and scale
- Understanding of AI in education context (Accessible Digital Textbooks, etc.)

**Data Analytics:**
- Google Analytics, performance measurement, effectiveness tracking
- Evidence-based optimization and reporting
- KPI development and monitoring

This technical fluency means I can execute independently, moving from strategy to implementation without extensive hand-holding—critical for a remote consultant role.

### 4. Independent Consultant Capability

My experience includes:
- Three years as independent consultant (2012-2015)
- Current remote/hybrid work at Telstra
- Managing multiple stakeholders across time zones
- Self-directed project management
- Delivering complex projects with minimal supervision

I know how to:
- Set up efficient remote working systems
- Communicate proactively with distributed teams
- Manage deliverables and timelines independently
- Build relationships virtually with stakeholders
- Maintain high productivity without direct oversight

### 5. Event Coordination & Partnership Communication

The role requires coordinating events like SLUSH, BETT, and Digital Education Week. I've supported major corporate events, product launches, and stakeholder gatherings throughout my career, understanding the communication requirements:

- Pre-event promotion and stakeholder coordination
- Real-time content creation and coverage
- Post-event follow-up and impact storytelling
- Liaison with partners, suppliers, and participants

### 6. Stakeholder Management Across Complex Organizations

I've successfully managed communication with:
- Executive leadership (C-suite at Telstra, Transurban, Techtronic)
- Cross-functional teams (UX, product, engineering, marketing)
- External partners and agencies
- Diverse customer/user bases
- International teams across time zones

This prepares me for UNICEF's stakeholder ecosystem:
- National Committee focal points
- Education Center of Excellence teams
- Country office communication teams
- Education Programme Group
- Partners and donors
- Rightsholders and communities

## Understanding the Unique Context

I recognize that UNICEF operates in a context very different from corporate Australia. However, I've done extensive research into:

**UNICEF's Digital Education Portfolio:**
- The five pillars of your 2025-2030 strategy
- EdTech for Good Framework's evaluation approach
- Blue Unicorn Portfolio's scaling methodology
- Learning Pioneers Programme's capacity-building model
- Specialized initiatives like Tinkering with Tech and Superstar Teacher Toolbox

**Education Equity Challenges:**
- Bridging digital divides (gender, disability, linguistic barriers)
- Reaching marginalized learners and out-of-school children
- Supporting education in humanitarian and disrupted contexts
- Making digital learning a public good

**Child Rights Framework:**
- UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
- Right to education as fundamental
- UNICEF's commitment to every child, especially the most vulnerable

**Development Communication:**
- Communication for behavior change
- Multi-stakeholder engagement in international development
- Cultural sensitivity and localization
- Evidence-based storytelling for impact

What I may lack in years of NGO experience, I compensate for with:
- **Genuine passion for the mission** (evidenced by my family's relocation decision)
- **Deep curiosity and fast learning capability**
- **Cultural humility and adaptability**
- **Professional standards from enterprise sector**
- **Fresh perspective on communication excellence**

## The Helsinki Advantage

Unlike most candidates applying from abroad, **I am already committed to relocating to Helsinki with my family in 2025.** This means:

**✅ No relocation uncertainty or visa complications**
- My wife is Finnish; we have family ties to Finland
- Our children will attend Finnish schools
- We're committed to building our life in Helsinki long-term

**✅ True hybrid capability**
- Can work from UNICEF offices in Helsinki when needed

This eliminates the risk of a remote consultant who's disconnected or may struggle with the remote nature of the role. I'll be **in Helsinki, committed to the community, and available for the full spectrum of in-person and remote collaboration.**

## Why This Role is the Perfect Fit

This 7-month consultancy (with 6-month extension possibility) represents an ideal opportunity:

- Learning from UNICEF's communication teams

## The Personal Connection That Matters

Many applicants can claim communication expertise. Many can point to impressive corporate careers. But how many can say: **"I believe so deeply in the transformative power of quality education that I'm moving my entire family across the world to ensure my children experience it"?**

That's not rhetoric. That's my reality.

When UNICEF talks about ensuring every child has access to world-class digital learning opportunities, I don't just understand it intellectually—I understand it as a parent who has made life-altering decisions to ensure my children have exactly that.

When you work on the Blue Unicorn Portfolio aiming to reach 100+ million children, those aren't just statistics to me. They're children who deserve what I'm actively securing for my own kids: the chance to learn, grow, and reach their full potential.

When UNICEF develops Accessible Digital Textbooks so children with disabilities can learn alongside their peers, that's not just a program description—it's the kind of inclusive education philosophy that made the Finnish system so attractive to our family.

## Why Now, Why UNICEF, Why Me

**Why Now:**
My family and I are relocating to Helsinki in 2025. I have 15 years of communication expertise ready to apply. UNICEF needs someone who can oversee communications for the Global Learning Innovation Hub. The timing is perfect.

**Why UNICEF:**
Because I want my professional work to align with what I've proven matters most to me: children's education. Because UNICEF is the global leader in ensuring every child—especially the most vulnerable—has access to learning opportunities. Because this role lets me contribute my skills to something that will still matter when my children ask what I did with my career.

**Why Me:**
- ✅ **Proven communication excellence** (15+ years, $2M+ projects, measurable results)
- ✅ **Education sector experience** (RMIT University, Kangan TAFE)
- ✅ **Three formal degrees** in communication disciplines
- ✅ **Technical capabilities** rare in non-profit sector
- ✅ **Independent consultant capability** for remote/hybrid work
- ✅ **Genuine mission alignment** proven by family relocation decision
- ✅ **Helsinki-based** from 2025 with long-term commitment
- ✅ **Immediate availability** and full dedication

## Closing Thoughts

Nelson Mandela said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."

My wife and I took that seriously enough to restructure our entire lives around it.

UNICEF takes it seriously enough to work toward 350+ million children having access to world-class digital learning.

Let me take my 15 years of strategic communication expertise—proven across Australia's largest telecommunications company, multimillion-dollar transformation projects, educational institutions, and diverse industries—and dedicate it fully to telling the world about UNICEF's transformative work in digital education.

I'm not looking for a job. I'm looking to contribute my skills to the cause my family has literally relocated our lives for: ensuring children receive the education they deserve.

I bring professional excellence, personal conviction, and a Helsinki address.

Let's ensure every child has access to the kind of education I'm moving across the world to secure for mine.

With deep commitment to UNICEF's mission,

**Rocco Marinelli**

*"The purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows." - Sydney J. Harris*

**I want to help UNICEF open those windows for every child.**

**Personal Note:**

My family's decision to move to Helsinki for our children's education isn't just about access to excellent schools. It's about the Finnish education philosophy: equity, accessibility, and the belief that every child deserves world-class learning opportunities regardless of background.

That philosophy—scaled globally—is exactly what UNICEF's Digital Education Strategy represents.

When my children ask me someday why we moved to Finland, I'll tell them: "Because we believed your education mattered that much."

When they ask what I did professionally while we were there, I want to say: "I helped UNICEF ensure millions of other children around the world had access to the same quality education opportunities you had."

That's the kind of work that matters.

That's the kind of impact I want to contribute to.

That's why I'm applying for this role.
